# Fermat's Last Theorem - Near Misses

## What it does
Searches for near misses to Fermat's Last Theorem. Basically finds x, y, z where x^n + y^n is really close to z^n but not exactly equal.

## How to run
Make sure you have Python 3 installed, then:
```
python fermat_near_misses.py
```
It will ask you for n (the exponent, 3-11) and k (upper limit for x and y, must be > 10).

Or just run the exe file:
```
fermat_near_misses.exe
```
